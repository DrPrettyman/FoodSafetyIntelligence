## Data Notes

### EUR-Lex Access Methods Tested (2026-02-20)

**1. Cellar REST API — WORKS, recommended approach**
- Endpoint: `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/celex/{CELEX_ID}`
- No authentication required. No API key, no registration.
- Uses HTTP content negotiation. Must set headers:
  - `Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9`
  - `Accept-Language: eng`
- CRITICAL: Must accept BOTH `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml`. Older documents (pre-~2010) are `text/html` only. Requesting only `application/xhtml+xml` returns 404 for those.
- Server returns a 303 redirect to the actual Cellar manifestation URL, e.g.:
  `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/d2e5f917-9fd7-11e5-8781-01aa75ed71a1.0006.03/DOC_1`
- No rate limit headers observed. Added 1s delay between requests to be polite.

Test results:

| CELEX | Document | Size | Content-Type |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| 32015R2283 | Novel Foods Regulation | 200,184 bytes | application/xhtml+xml |
| 32002R0178 | General Food Law | 114,573 bytes | text/html |
| 32004R0852 | Food Hygiene | 182,141 bytes | application/xhtml+xml |
| 32004R0853 | Hygiene of foodstuffs of animal origin | 671,259 bytes | application/xhtml+xml |
| 32017R0625 | Official Controls | 1,687,294 bytes | application/xhtml+xml |

Estimated total corpus size for ~120 docs: 30-60 MB. Download time ~2-3 min with delays.

**2. EUR-Lex website URLs — DO NOT WORK for programmatic access**
- URL pattern: `https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2283`
- Returns HTTP 202 with an AWS WAF JavaScript challenge page. The response contains:
  `<script src="https://3e3378af7cd0.a62927d9.eu-west-1.token.awswaf.com/.../challenge.js">`
- Would require a headless browser (Selenium/Playwright) to bypass — unnecessary when Cellar works.

**3. SPARQL Endpoint (Cellar) — WORKS for metadata/discovery**
- Endpoint: `https://publications.europa.eu/webapi/rdf/sparql`
- No authentication required.
- Request: GET with `query` param, `Accept: application/sparql-results+json`
- Useful for discovering documents by topic, but not needed for download if we already have CELEX numbers.
- Key EuroVoc URIs for food safety:
  - `http://eurovoc.europa.eu/6569` — "food safety"
  - `http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1590` — "foodstuffs legislation"
  - `http://eurovoc.europa.eu/2735` — "foodstuff"
  - `http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1284` — "human nutrition"
  - `http://eurovoc.europa.eu/7126` — "European Food Safety Authority"
- Resource type URIs: `REG` for regulations, `DIR` for directives.
- Simple queries with specific URIs return fast. Regex-based or `GROUP BY` queries on large result sets can time out.
- From Jan 2026: results limited to 10,000 per query (irrelevant for our ~120 doc use case).

Working SPARQL query for food safety regulations:
```sparql
PREFIX cdm: <http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/cdm#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?celex ?title
WHERE {
  ?work cdm:resource_legal_id_celex ?celex .
  ?work cdm:work_has_resource-type <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/REG> .
  ?work cdm:work_is_about_concept_eurovoc <http://eurovoc.europa.eu/6569> .
  ?expression cdm:expression_belongs_to_work ?work .
  ?expression cdm:expression_uses_language <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/ENG> .
  ?expression cdm:expression_title ?title .
}
ORDER BY DESC(?celex)
LIMIT 30
```

### HTML Format Differences

Two distinct formats encountered:

**Newer format (post-~2013, XHTML):**
- Content-Type: `application/xhtml+xml;charset=UTF-8`
- Generated by CONVEX converter
- Has ELI (European Legislation Identifier) semantic markup
- Key CSS classes for parsing:
  - `.eli-container` — root container
  - `.eli-main-title` — regulation title
  - `.eli-subdivision` — structural divisions
  - `.oj-ti-section-1` — Chapter headings
  - `.oj-ti-section-2` — Section headings
  - `.oj-ti-art` — Article headings (e.g., "Article 1")
  - `.oj-sti-art` — Article subtitles (e.g., "Subject matter and purpose")
  - `.oj-normal` — Normal paragraph text
  - `.oj-doc-ti` — Document title text
  - `.oj-note` — Footnotes
- Structural IDs: `tit_1`, `pbl_1` (preamble), `art_N` (articles), `enc_1` (enacting terms)

**Older format (pre-~2010, HTML 4.01):**
- Content-Type: `text/html;charset=UTF-8`
- Dublin Core metadata in `<meta>` tags
- Main content in `<div id="TexteOnly">` → `<TXT_TE>` tag
- All content is bare `<p>` tags with NO CSS classes
- Articles identifiable only by text pattern: `<p>Article N</p>` followed by subtitle paragraph
- 32002R0178 (General Food Law) has 65 articles in this format
- Parsing requires regex-based article boundary detection, not CSS class matching

**Formex 4 XML (`fmx4`):** The `fmx4` format available from Cellar is NOT the full text — it's a metadata wrapper/TOC. Not useful for our purposes. XHTML/HTML is the way to go.

### Python Packages Evaluated

| Package | Version | Last Updated | Status |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `eurlex` | 0.1.4 | Jun 2023 | Uses EUR-Lex website URLs — likely broken due to WAF |
| `eurlex-toolbox` | N/A | May 2024 (GitHub only) | Not on PyPI. Pre-built corpus (2009-2019). Not useful for targeted downloads. |
| `pyeurlex` | 0.2.9 | Sep 2022 | SPARQL-based. Stale. |
| `eurlex-parser` | 0.0.13 | Aug 2024 | Has `get_articles_by_celex_id()`. Most recent. Worth investigating for parsing, not download. |

**Decision: Write our own downloader.** The Cellar REST API is simple enough that a custom function is better than depending on stale third-party packages. Download is ~15 lines of code.

## What Worked

- **Cellar REST API** is the clear winner for document download. Simple, fast, no auth, no rate limits observed.
- **SPARQL endpoint** is useful for corpus discovery (finding CELEX numbers by EuroVoc topic).
- **Content negotiation** with both `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml` in the Accept header handles both old and new documents.
- **pyproject.toml**: build-backend must be `setuptools.build_meta`, NOT `setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend` (the latter doesn't exist and breaks `pip install -e`).
- **Python 3.14** is what's installed (`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`). Use `python3` not `python`. Venv at `.venv/`.

## What Didn't Work

- **EUR-Lex website URLs** are now behind AWS WAF bot protection (as of testing date). Returns a JS challenge page, not document content. Do not use for programmatic access.
- **Existing Python packages** are all stale (oldest: 2022, newest: Aug 2024). None recommended for production use.
- **Formex 4 XML** format from Cellar is just a metadata wrapper, not the full document text. XHTML is the correct format.
- **Requesting only `application/xhtml+xml`** in the Accept header fails for older documents (returns 404). Must include `text/html` as well.

## Open Questions

- How consistent are the CSS classes across all ~120 documents? Need to parse a few from different eras and categories to check.
- `eurlex-parser` package has an `get_articles_by_celex_id()` function — worth testing to see if its parsing logic is reusable, or if we need to build from scratch.
- How do annexes appear in the HTML structure? Annexes contain the actual regulated substance lists (E-numbers, Union List, etc.) and may need special parsing.
- Cross-reference links in the HTML — are they `<a>` tags pointing to other CELEX numbers? If so, we can build the dependency graph from the HTML itself.
