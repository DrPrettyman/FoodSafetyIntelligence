## Before starting any work, read these files for context:

1. `planning/comprehensivePlan.md` — Full project plan: business problem, architecture, data sources, evaluation framework, timeline
2. `planning/general/portfolio-advice-article.md` — What hiring managers care about in data science portfolios
3. `planning/general/portfolio-principles-reference.md` — 7 research-backed principles for portfolio design (2024-2026)
4. `planning/general/modern-framework-project-ideas.md` — The four candidate project ideas and how they fit together

## Project Log

**`notes.md`** is the running project log. Read it before starting any session to understand current state.

- Record what was done, what worked, what didn't, and what data transformations were needed
- Update it at the end of every work session
- Keep entries concise and factual — this is a reference, not a journal
- Use the section structure already in the file (Progress Log, Data Notes, What Worked / What Didn't, Open Questions)
